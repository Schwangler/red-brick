- for a bug in the `qemu-arm-static` binary, Mono installtion hangs in the chroot
  environment. Mono is enabled currently by selecting essential packages manually
  but `mono-complete` installation will fail in chroot environment. Same for GTK#
  libraries for Mono

- compat ID detection for WinUSB with a USB composite device with more than one
  interface dosn't work on Windows XP

- a Brick connected to the USB host port on the RED Brick only works if it was
  connected before boot. it doesn't work if it was hotplugged after boot. is
  this still true?

- acpid is complaining about not working netlink communication with the kernel.
  are we missing a kernle module for this?
