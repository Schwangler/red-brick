- find a way to keep ownership of the config files consistent during copying
  root-fs patches

- fsck on boot must not ask any question, it just should fix any issue
  automatically. currently it can just sit there ask you a question and wait
  for an answer, but there's nobody to asnwer it

- kernel boot can hang between this two lines:

  <30>udevd[161]: starting version 175
  <6>EXT3-fs (mmcblk0p1): using internal journal

  this might be related to a problem in the prepared root-fs, as rebuilding
  it seems to fix it. but there was one case were an already working image got
  into this state
