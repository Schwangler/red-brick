- kernel boot can hang between this two lines:

  <30>udevd[161]: starting version 175
  <6>EXT3-fs (mmcblk0p1): using internal journal

  this might be related to a problem in the prepared root-fs, as rebuilding
  it seems to fix it. but there was one case were an already working image got
  into this state

- find a way to fix the apt sources in the final image when the image is being
  generated with apt-cacher on
