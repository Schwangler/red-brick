NOTE: The development of the fast image was stopped. Instead of different image
flavors (full and fast) there is only one image (previously known as full image)
now. In the new full image different services (desktop environment, web server,
wireless access point, etc.) can be enabled/disabled. This allows to customize
the new full image for different requirements.
